 <h1 id="title">ABOUT PHIL</h1>
 <p> Somebody Feed Phil is 
    an American television travel documentary 
    series presented by Philip Rosenthal that premiered on Netflix on January 12, 2018.
    Each episode follows Rosenthal touring the cuisine of the episode's featured city, 
    and spotlights charities and non-profit organizations that operate in the region.
    <br>
    <br>
    The show is a spiritual successor to Rosenthal's previous show on PBS, 
    I'll Have What Phil's Having. 
    When Rosenthal moved the program from PBS to Netflix, 
    a theme song recorded by the band Lake Street Dive was added to the opening.
    <br> <br>
    Phil's brother Rich Rosenthal serves as executive producer and showrunner of the series, 
    and sometimes appears on camera to sample food at Phil's urging.
    <br> <br>
    A companion cookbook to the series, Somebody Feed Phil: The Book, is scheduled to be released in October 2022 </p>
